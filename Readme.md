#Brief writeup # #####

This is a typescript tutorial I started on 31/08/2020 and concluded on 02/09/2020
I included this markdown to remind myself or anyone who forks this project to always 
include a tsconfig.json file to configure or customize settings based on their preference
(This is totally optional). Configurations can be basic or complex. This heavily depends on your 
project and needs. 

A tsconfig.json file can be created from the commandline using the command below:

    -> typescript --init

Refer to the original docs on the official typescript for the actual setup if this makes no sense.
As stated earlier, I wrote this to remind myself of how to include a tsconfig.json file.

Happy coding:) CeeJay_OriginalðŸ˜Ž
